List of my CVE published

* **CVE-2019-19589** The Lever PDF Embedder plugin 4.4 for WordPress does not block the distribution of polyglot PDF documents that are valid JAR archives. https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19589

* **CVE-2019-19889** An issue was discovered on Humax Wireless Voice Gateway HGB10R-2 20160817_1855 devices. The attacker can discover admin credentials in the backup file, aka backupsettings.conf. https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19889

* **CVE-2019-19890** An issue was discovered on Humax Wireless Voice Gateway HGB10R-2 20160817_1855 devices. Admin credentials are sent over cleartext HTTP. https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19890

* **CVE-2019-19916** In Midori Browser 0.5.11 (on Windows 10), Content Security Policy (CSP) is not applied correctly to all parts of multipart content sent with the multipart/x-mixed-replace MIME type. This could result in script running where CSP should have blocked it, allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks when the product renders the content as HTML. Remediating this would also need to consider the polyglot case, e.g., a file that is a valid GIF image and also valid JavaScript. https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19916

* In Internet Explorer 11, Content Security Policy (CSP) is not applied correctly to all parts of multipart content sent with the multipart/x-mixed-replace MIME type. This could result in script running where CSP should have blocked it, allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks when the product renders the content as HTML. Remediating this would also need to consider the polyglot case, e.g., a file that is a valid GIF image and also valid JavaScript. [awaiting]
